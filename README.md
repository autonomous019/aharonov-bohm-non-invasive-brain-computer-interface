The Aharonov–Bohm Effect in Biological
Systems: Phase, Coherence, and Vector
Potentials
Introduction: Aharonov–Bohm Effect and Phase Influence
The  Aharonov–Bohm effect (AB effect)  is a quantum phenomenon in which charged particles are
affected  by  the  electromagnetic  potential  even  in  regions  where  classical  electromagnetic  fields
(electric $\mathbf{E}$ and magnetic $\mathbf{B}$) are zero . In the classic AB setup, an electron
beam is split into two paths that go around a region containing a magnetic flux (e.g. inside a solenoid)
but with the magnetic field confined so that it does not directly touch the electrons. Remarkably, even
though the electrons experience no local $\mathbf{B}$ field, the presence of the vector potential $
\mathbf{A}$ associated with the enclosed flux shifts the interference pattern on a detection screen. The
electron wavefunctions acquire a  phase shift  proportional to the  magnetic vector potential line
integral  around the loop :
where $q$ is the particle's charge and the integral is taken along the particle’s path $P$ around the flux
region. This phase shift has been observed experimentally, confirming that $\mathbf{A}$ (the  vector
potential ) has tangible physical effects despite the classical fields being zero outside the solenoid
. In other words,  electromagnetic potentials can influence the  quantum phase** of particles
(altering interference outcomes) without imparting force or energy in the classical sense. This contrasts
with classical electromagnetism, where only fields have direct physical significance – the AB effect
revealed that in quantum mechanics the potentials themselves play a fundamental role .
Mathematically , the AB phase arises from the coupling of $\mathbf{A}$ to the phase of the particle’s
wavefunction in the Schrödinger equation. Under a gauge transformation $\mathbf{A}\to \mathbf{A} +
\nabla\chi$,  the  wavefunction  gains  a  position-dependent  phase  $e^{iq\chi/\hbar}$,  which  leaves
observable predictions invariant. Thus, only the gauge-invariant  loop integral of $\mathbf{A}$ (related
to the enclosed flux $\Phi_B=\oint \mathbf{A}\cdot d\ell$) matters physically. The AB effect is a prime
example of a geometric phase  (or Berry phase) in quantum theory, showing how the “phase landscape”
of a system can be shaped by potentials in a field-free  region. This concept of shaping quantum phase
without energy transfer is at the heart of how AB-related ideas might extend to complex systems,
including biological systems .
Vector Potentials and Phase Relationships in Biological Systems
In biological contexts, we normally consider electromagnetic influences in terms of field intensities and
energy transfer (e.g. induced currents, heating, etc.). However , if certain processes in biology involve
quantum coherence – electrons, spins, or other degrees of freedom maintaining phase relationships –
then  vector potentials might subtly affect those phase relationships  even at extremely low field
strengths. Current research indeed suggests that magnetic vector potentials can play an active role in1

biological processes . For example, some studies on weak magnetic field bioeffects  have found it
useful to describe the interaction in terms of vector potential rather than just $\mathbf{B}$ field,
especially when direct forces are negligible . The idea is that a structured $\mathbf{A}$ field  could bias
the phases of quantum states in the system without classical force – analogous to the AB effect.
Quantum systems in biology  that could be sensitive to phase shifts include: 
Water Coherence Domains:  Water in cells isn’t just a random solvent; quantum physicists have
hypothesized that water can form coherent domains  where dipoles oscillate in unison. If such
domains  exist  (as  proposed  by  Preparata,  Del  Giudice,  etc.),  they  could  support  collective
quantum states. A vector potential spanning a coherent water domain might shift its phase or
coherence  properties  without  needing  strong  fields.  Indeed,  it  has  been  proposed  that  the
vector potential can modify the quantum states of water , potentially altering cascades of
biochemical  reactions  (for  instance,  those  governed  by  phosphorylating  ions  with  magnetic
nuclei ). While these ideas are still speculative, they provide a framework where phase, not
energy, carries information .
Electron  or  Dipole  Oscillations  in  Proteins  and  Microtubules:  Proteins  (and  cytoskeletal
structures like microtubules ) contain arrays of dipoles and possibly delocalized electrons (e.g. in
aromatic amino acids). Quantum models of microtubules suggest they might support excitations
or spin states that remain phase-coherent under certain conditions . For instance, dipole
coupling  between  tubulin  subunits  can  be  modeled  with  quantum  spin  operators  in  some
theories of quantum computation in microtubules . If electrons or excitons in such a structure
form a collective mode, an external $\mathbf{A}$ field (from an applied electromagnetic signal)
could impart a phase shift to these modes. Even without driving an electronic transition, the
phase of an electron’s wavefunction or a spin orientation  might be tweaked by a vector potential
threading the structure. Over many proteins or tubulin dimers, this amounts to changing the
phase landscape  of the system’s state. A subtle phase shift could tip a delicate balance – for
example, altering the timing of how certain protein conformational changes synchronize, or
modulating reaction rates if quantum tunneling is involved.
Spin Systems in Biology:  Biology also hosts numerous spin-bearing particles – electrons in
radicals, nuclear spins in certain atoms, even possibly exotic proposals like Posner molecules
protecting  phosphorus  nuclear  spin  coherence .  Magnetic  spin  coherence  can  survive
relatively  long  in  conducive  environments  (much  longer  than  electronic  coherence) .  If  a
biomolecule has two spin states (up/down) in superposition – essentially forming a  qubit  – a
magnetic  vector  potential  could  shift  the  relative  phase  between  spin-up  and  spin-down
components if the spins traverse different paths or environments (this is analogous to how a
neutron’s spin can acquire phase via the Aharonov–Casher effect, a cousin of AB effect). In
biology, one prominent spin-coherence example is the  radical pair mechanism  used in bird
navigation :  a  pair  of  radicals  (each  with  an  unpaired  electron  spin)  react  differently
depending on their spin-singlet vs triplet phase relationship, which is influenced by magnetic
fields.  While  the  standard  radical  pair  model  emphasizes  $\mathbf{B}$-field  effects  on  spin
precession, one can also conceive of $\mathbf{A}$-field influence if the geometry allows a loop.
In general, if a spin or magnetic moment encircles an area with flux, it could gain an AB phase.
Thus,  one  might  speculate  that  biomolecules  containing  ring  currents  or  spin  currents
(perhaps electron currents circulating in aromatic rings or ion channels) could be subject to AB-
like phase shifts from applied vector potentials. This could modulate reaction yields or signal
transduction efficiency in a subtle, non-thermal way.5

Crucially, for any of these scenarios, some degree of quantum coherence  or at least wave-like behavior in
the biological system is required. The AB effect is fundamentally an interference phenomenon – you
only see an outcome if a particle’s wave can split and recombine. In a noisy, wet biological environment
at body temperature, maintaining coherence is challenging. Nonetheless, biology has surprised us with
quantum  effects  (e.g.  quantum  tunneling  in  enzymes ,  coherent  exciton  transport  in
photosynthetic complexes , spin coherence in bird compasses). Therefore, theorists have ventured that
if small pockets of coherence exist in neurons, microtubules, or water clusters, an external vector
potential could “tune” their phase relations much like a dial,  without depositing energy  the way a
strong  field  would.  This  is  a  form  of  information  transfer  via  vector  potential :  imparting  phase
information  to a system in lieu of energy or force. A “structured” or patterned $\mathbf{A}(t)$ could
essentially  carry  a  signal  into  the  quantum  degrees  of  freedom  of  tissue,  nudging  how  processes
proceed.
One  concrete  speculative  example  is  in  migratory  birds :  beyond  the  spin-based  compass
(cryptochrome radical pairs), birds also incorporate tiny magnetite crystals in their bodies. Bókkon and
Salari  (2010)  hypothesized  that  these  biomagnetite  crystals  might  act  as  biological  AB  devices,
recording  the  magnetic  vector  potential  along  the  bird’s  journey .  The  idea  is  that  as  a  bird
traverses Earth’s field, the magnetite (in concert with neuronal electromagnetic activity) could encode
phase information corresponding to the Earth’s vector potential map of the route . In essence, the
bird’s brain could be storing a quantum phase imprint  of its migratory path – a bold idea linking AB-
phase  memory  to  navigation.  Whether  or  not  this  specific  mechanism  holds,  it  illustrates  how
researchers are extending AB effect concepts to explain biological information processing: phases and
potentials as carriers of bio-information , not just field strengths.
Phase Coherence and Non-Local Coupling: From Physics to
Biology
One hallmark of the AB effect is that it introduces a sort of  non-local influence  – the particles are
influenced by a field (or rather a potential) in a region they never visit. This raises an intriguing question:
could  phase  coherence  induced  by  vector  potentials  lead  to  coupling  between  separate  systems
without  energy  exchange,  even  at  a  distance?  In  physics,  we  have  analogies  like  two  distant
superconductors connected only by a shared electromagnetic mode: e.g. in a SQUID (superconducting
quantum  interference  device),  the  superconducting  currents  in  two  arms  of  a  ring  remain  phase-
coherent through the enclosed flux. If two spatially separated quantum systems share the same global
vector potential structure , they might exhibit phase locking  relative to each other – somewhat like
two pendulum clocks synchronized by a long belt. 
In a thought experiment, imagine two identical setups that are shielded so that no classical EM field
passes between them, yet each is subjected to the same time-varying vector potential pattern . This could
be achieved, for example, by synchronizing coil currents in both locations in an identical manner . From a
classical view, if perfectly shielded, neither system gets energy from the other . But from a quantum
phase perspective, each system’s internal phase might be evolving according to the same $\mathbf{A}
(t)$ influence. If those systems had some quantum correspondence initially (say similar entangled
states or simply identical preparedness), they could evolve in a  phase-coherent fashion  with each
other . In other words, their quantum states could remain correlated in phase as if part of one larger
interferometer that spans two labs. This scenario is highly speculative, but it resonates with the AB
principle: phase coherence established via potentials, not forces .
Some experimentalists have reported puzzling non-local effects in biology-like setups  that evoke this
idea.  For  instance,  S.   Kernbach  and  colleagues  conducted  “mirrored”  experiments  with  electronic1011

devices and found that  two spatially separated devices could behave as a single phase-coherent
system under certain conditions . In one set of experiments, an LED-based signal generator was
influencing a nearby water-based detector; when a second, identical setup was placed in another room
(tens of meters away or more) and driven in synchrony with the first, the distant detector showed subtle
responses as if it were still coupled to the original generator . Even with electromagnetic shielding in
place, the phase influence appeared to persist for some time after the systems were separated. The
researchers interpreted this in terms of an  entanglement-like or phase-coupled field  linking the
devices .  One  could  speculate  that  a  common  vector  potential  structure  (from  the  synchronized
modulation) was effectively “bridging” the two setups, maintaining a degree of phase coherence (a
concept akin to AB effect but on a macroscopic scale). It’s important to note these observations are
controversial and not yet widely reproduced; however , they provide a provocative theoretical picture:
that  phase information  (as opposed to energy) might be shared across distances via non-classical
fields.
From a broader perspective,  non-local phase coupling  is not entirely foreign to physics. Aside from
entanglement in quantum mechanics, even classical wave systems can show phase synchronization
without direct contact if they are driven by a common source. For example, two radio antennas fed by
the same oscillator emit waves in phase; two separate atomic clocks disciplined by the same reference
signal stay in phase. By analogy, if two biological or electronic systems each receive a phase reference
from the same patterned $\mathbf{A}(t)$ field, they could oscillate in unison. The novelty in the AB-like
scenario is that this reference might be provided by a potential that does not register as a classical field
in the space between the systems – thus appearing “non-local” in effect. 
In summary, the AB effect teaches us that phase coherence can be influenced through potentials in
subtle  ways .  Applying  this  lesson  to  biology  suggests  that  nature  might  exploit  similar  tricks:
organisms could use not just energy flows but phase synchronization to coordinate processes at a
distance. This could be part of what some authors term “quantum non-locality in biology” . While highly
speculative, it stretches our imagination of communication in biological networks – perhaps cells or
neurons could be “phase-entangled” by fields in a way that standard biochemistry alone cannot explain.
Any  robust  theory  here  must,  of  course,  respect  quantum  decoherence  and  known  physics;  thus,
ongoing research is focused on whether certain biological structures can preserve coherence long
enough  and whether  electromagnetic potentials can indeed orchestrate functional changes  at
biological scales.
Dynamic Modulation vs Static Fields: The Significance of
Acceleration
A recurring theme in bioelectromagnetics is that time-varying signals  have very different effects from
static fields. The phrase “accelerating rhythms cut through static fields” reflects the observation that a
changing or modulated field  can produce responses where a steady field does not. There are several
theoretical reasons why the acceleration (time variation) of a field  is significant:
Inducing  Electric  Fields:  Maxwell’s  equations  tell  us  that  a  time-varying  magnetic  vector
potential $\mathbf{A}(t)$ induces an electric field since $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla \Phi - \frac{\partial
\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}$. A  static  $\mathbf{A}$ (as in the static AB effect) might shift quantum
phases without forces, but it won’t drive currents or polarization in classical media. The moment
$\mathbf{A}$ is varied in time (i.e. an accelerating change), a nonzero $\partial \mathbf{A}/
\partial t$ creates an $\mathbf{E}$ field that can directly interact  with charges. Biological tissue
strongly responds to electric fields  (nerve stimulation, ion transport, etc.), so a dynamic vector
potential can have a dual effect: imparting phase information and also exerting small forces via12

induced $\mathbf{E}$. This means an oscillating or pulsed signal can “get through” where a
static offset might be inert. It’s akin to how a  radio signal (AC)  passes through a circuit via
capacitive/inductive coupling, whereas a DC (static) bias might be blocked by a capacitor – the
AC changes bypass barriers  that stop DC. In biological terms, static magnetic fields often show
minimal or no immediate effect (cells can adapt or ignore a steady field), whereas time-varying
fields  (especially  with  specific  frequency  content)  can  resonate  with  cellular  processes  (e.g.
membrane ion channel kinetics, or cyclotron resonance of ions as some have hypothesized ).
Overcoming  Shielding  and  Adaptation:  Many  biological  and  experimental  setups  include
shielding or homeostatic mechanisms that cancel out static influences. For example, a static
magnetic field might be compensated by organisms (they habituate to Earth’s steady field).
However , an  accelerating or pulsed field  can produce transients that these shields or adaptive
responses  cannot  cancel  instantly.  If  you  imagine  a  "static  field  environment"  as  a  sort  of
equilibrium,  a  sudden  change  (an  acceleration )  is  a  non-equilibrium  perturbation  that  can
penetrate. In practical terms, even a well-shielded Faraday cage that blocks static electric fields
will develop induced currents on its walls when exposed to a rapid pulse, which can momentarily
create internal fields. Likewise, biological membranes that are insulated to DC might allow AC or
pulses to pass signals (this principle is used in electric pulse-mediated drug delivery  and nerve
stimulation). Therefore, a rhythmic acceleration  of a signal can “cut through” static conditions
by exploiting the system’s finite response time . The faster or more abrupt the change, the
harder it is for the system to fully negate it.
Selective Resonance:  An accelerating rhythm (for instance, a frequency sweep or a pulse train)
can excite specific dynamical modes in a target system. Static fields have no frequency; they’re
like a constant bias. But life is dynamic – cells and tissues have numerous oscillatory activities
(heartbeat, brain waves, oscillating chemical reactions, etc.). By tuning the modulation frequency
of a field, one might match a resonance  of the biological system, greatly amplifying the effect.
For example, certain calcium ion fluxes or enzyme reaction cycles could respond at particular
frequencies. If a modulated electromagnetic signal “accelerates” at just the right rate (say, pulses
at  a  gamma-band  frequency  that  neurons  use,  or  at  a  frequency  matching  a  microtubule
vibration mode), it may induce a disproportionately large response compared to a static or off-
resonance field. This is essentially driving the system in sync with its natural rhythms , slicing
through the background noise. In contrast, a static field is like a DC input – easily filtered out by
the inherent AC nature of biological signaling (neurons communicate in spikes, not sustained DC
level differences).
In the context of the AB effect and phase, a time-varying vector potential  is also interesting because it
could  modulate  quantum  phase  dynamically .  Instead  of  giving  a  one-time  static  phase  offset,  a
changing $\mathbf{A}(t)$ might continuously tweak phases – potentially even causing  oscillations in
interference patterns . However , one must be cautious: a  slowly  varying $\mathbf{A}(t)$ within a single
coherent system would produce a  time-dependent AB phase  which is equivalent (through gauge
choice) to a mix of AB phase and real induced fields. If varied too fast, the system might not remain
coherent to follow the phase adiabatically. Thus, in designing “phase signaling” via $\mathbf{A}$, one
might choose modulation speeds commensurate with the coherence times of the system (more on this
below).  The  key  point  is  that  adding  acceleration  (change)  to  the  signal  opens  up  channels  of
interaction (both quantum and classical) that a static situation lacked. 
In summary, acceleration in the context of fields and potentials is significant because it is the gateway
between pure phase effects  and tangible force effects . It allows a potentially “stealth” channel like a
vector potential to actually interface with noisy biological matter by periodically nudging it. The AB
effect at heart doesn’t require a time-varying flux – it’s usually demonstrated with static flux producing a13

static  phase  difference.  But  in  a  biological  setting,  to  leverage  AB-like  effects,  one  might  employ
modulated fields  so that there is both a coherent phase imprint  and enough temporal structure to
avoid being lost in static noise .
The 3 ms vs 5 ms Puzzle: Timing, Coherence, and Resonance
An intriguing empirical observation (noted in the question) is that using  3 ms pulses with pauses
might produce a significant effect whereas 5 ms pulses do not. Let’s unpack possible theoretical reasons
for why a seemingly small timing difference – pulses separated by 3 ms (~333 Hz repetition) versus 5 ms
(200 Hz) – could matter for a phase-mediated mechanism.
1. Matching Internal Timescales (Coherence Time):  In any system with quantum coherence or even
classical oscillators, there is a characteristic decoherence time or memory time . If pulses arrive faster
than this time, the system can integrate their effects coherently . If they come too slowly, the system
loses phase memory between pulses, and the effects just wash out. Suppose a population of spins or
dipoles in a biological structure has a coherence time on the order of a few milliseconds. Then a 3 ms
gap between pulses might be short enough that the phase shift from one pulse is still “remembered”
when the next pulse arrives. The phase deviations can accumulate constructively. However , a 5 ms gap
might exceed the coherence time – by the time the next pulse comes, the phase of the system has
randomized  (or  the  oscillation  damped  out).  In  that  case,  each  pulse  acts  in  isolation,  and  the
cumulative  effect  is  much  smaller .  In  essence,  3   ms  pulsing  could  resonate  with  the  system’s
coherence, whereas 5 ms is too slow, falling into a regime where coherence decays . It’s notable
that neural firing and many synaptic processes occur on a few-millisecond scale; 3 ms is roughly the
duration of an action potential or the refractory period of a neuron. So a 3 ms pulse pattern could
potentially interact with neurons at the upper end of their firing capability (~300 Hz), possibly entraining
fast neuronal oscillations or resonating with fast molecular vibrations. 5 ms pulses (200 Hz) are slower
and might not hit the same resonance if the system’s sweet spot is higher .
2. Fourier Spectrum and Frequency Content:  A pulse train with a 3 ms interval contains higher-
frequency Fourier components than one with a 5 ms interval. In other words, the shorter the pulse
repetition,  the  broader  and  higher  the  spectrum  of  frequencies  injected  into  the  system.  If  the
biological  target  has  a  frequency-dependent  response  (as  most  do),  the  two  pulse  trains  excite  it
differently.  Perhaps  the  effective  mechanism  requires  reaching  a  threshold  frequency  to  trigger  a
response.  For  example,  imagine  a  molecular  ion  channel  that  responds  to  oscillating  fields  above
250 Hz – then a 333 Hz (3 ms) train can stimulate it, while 200 Hz (5 ms) cannot. Some studies on weak-
field bioeffects have invoked frequency windows where effects are seen only in certain bands .
The  Lednev  1991  model  for  weak  magnetic  field  effects,  for  instance,  proposed  specific  Larmor
frequencies of ions that must be matched . It’s conceivable that 333 Hz lies near a particular ionic
cyclotron  or  vibrational  frequency  in  the  experimental  conditions,  whereas  200   Hz  does  not.
Additionally, shorter pulses mean sharper “edges” (greater acceleration), which yield stronger high-
frequency transients that might momentarily perturb the system more effectively than gentler 5 ms
pulses.
3. Nonlinear Feedback and “Sweet Spots”:  Biological systems often respond nonlinearly to stimuli. If
one is modulating a complex network (say, a network of spin-coupled molecules or neurons), the output
might only spike once the drive exceeds a certain rate. The 3 ms vs 5 ms difference could be analogous
to pushing someone on a swing: if you push at the right rhythm, the swing goes higher (resonance), but
a slightly off-rhythm push can actually dampen the motion. Perhaps 3 ms pulsing hits a  feedback
sweet spot  in which each pulse arrives just as the system begins to relax, giving it another jolt in phase
– effectively  pumping the phase coherence  constructively. At 5 ms, each pulse comes too late, by1314
13
6

which time the system might have settled into a less responsive state (or moved out of phase such that
pulses add destructively). In quantum terms, 3 ms spacing might coincide with a 2π phase rotation  of
some part of the system’s wavefunction, so each pulse nudges it further along a preferred direction in
Hilbert space. 5 ms could correspond to a non-integer multiple of some natural period, causing pulses
to sometimes push against the accumulated phase rather than with it.
While we don’t have a definitive theory pinned down (since this touches on new science being probed),
we can draw a parallel: NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and spin echo techniques  use carefully
timed pulse sequences to manipulate phase. A 180° pulse followed by a certain delay can refocus spins
(a  spin  echo)  –  but  timing  is  critical;  a  wrong  delay  gives  no  echo.  Similarly,  in  coherent  control
experiments  in chemistry, femtosecond laser pulse spacing is tuned to steer reactions. By analogy, the
3 ms vs 5 ms could be the difference between building a coherent echo in a biological medium versus
letting it dephase. If one treats the modulated field as creating a series of AB-like phase shifts, then
3 ms spacing might allow those shifts to add up in the same phase , while 5 ms spacing leads to phase
cancellation over cycles.
4. Physiological Noise Filtering:  Another mundane but relevant factor: a lot of biological electrical
noise (from muscles, environment, etc.) is in the 0–200 Hz range. The brain’s own dominant rhythms are
delta (~1–4 Hz), theta (~5–8 Hz), alpha (~10 Hz), beta (~20 Hz), gamma (~40–100 Hz). A signal at 333 Hz
lies above most brain activity, so it might stand out against the “static” of lower-frequency fluctuations.
At 200 Hz, the difference is smaller but still above typical neural oscillations. It could be that the
experimental detectors or biological receptors have a noise floor that is higher at 200 Hz than at 333 Hz,
making the latter easier to detect. In practice, some electrosensory systems  (like in weakly electric fish
or even human brain stimulation techniques) use >300 Hz carriers to avoid interfering with normal
neurosignaling and to exploit non-linear envelope detection. The 3 ms pulsing might effectively be a
way of delivering a  high-frequency carrier  with some encoded phase pattern, whereas 5 ms is a
slightly lower-frequency carrier that maybe gets lost or causes different interference patterns.
In summary, the effectiveness of 3 ms pauses over 5 ms likely points to a combination of resonance
with the system’s natural frequencies and coherence times , and the  spectral differences  in the
stimuli. The exact “3 ms” value might not be universally special, but in the context of the specific system
studied, it emerged as a critical timescale – hinting at an underlying quantum or classical oscillatory
process that has that timescale. Theoretically, one would investigate this by modeling the system’s
response  in  the  frequency  domain  and  looking  for  peaks  in  sensitivity  around  300–400   Hz,  or  by
modeling a two-pulse interference effect and seeing at what interval the second pulse constructively
interferes with the first.
Conclusion and Broader Context
The  exploration  of  Aharonov–Bohm-like  effects  in  biology  sits  at  a  fascinating  intersection  of
quantum physics and life science. We have seen that the AB effect exemplifies how potentials  (not just
fields) can convey physical influence in the form of  phase shifts , and how this can lead to non-local
seeming interactions in purely quantum systems. Extending these ideas to biology, researchers propose
that  living  systems  might  harness  subtle  field  effects:  vector  potentials  structuring  phases  of
biomolecules, phase coherence enabling communication or memory, and dynamic modulation to
couple with biological rhythms . While experimental evidence for AB effects in living organisms is not
yet conclusive, the theoretical framework is being built from peer-reviewed advances in quantum
biology and bioelectromagnetics : from the role of biomagnetite and vector potential maps in bird
navigation , to the possibility of  long-lived spin coherences in the brain , and to empirical
reports of anomalous long-distance coherence between EM devices .10 8

It is important to stress that much of this remains hypothesis  and frontier science. However , even as a
conceptual tool, thinking in terms of phases and potentials broadens our view of biological signaling. It
suggests new experiments – for instance, using shielded interference setups to test if organisms can
sense potentials, or applying phase-tuned pulse sequences to influence biochemical reactions without
significant energy input. It also connects to well-established non-bio analogies:  for example, how AB
phases in solid-state nano-rings influence electron transport (a non-biological example), or how Josephson
junction arrays maintain phase coherence via gauge fields.  By comparing these, we gain broader context :
a laser interferometer and a microtubule network might not be so different if both are considered as
phase-sensitive systems – one just has more thermal noise and complexity. 
Ultimately, this line of inquiry might contribute to a deeper understanding of what one might call the
“quantum information biology”  of cells – how information (in the sense of phase or coherence) could
be encoded, transferred, and processed in the wet, warm environment of life. The  Aharonov–Bohm
effect provides a guiding principle : that not all influences come with energy and force; some come quietly
as shifts in phase . And as we continue to explore accelerating fields, tailored pulses, and quantum
sensors in biology, we may yet uncover subtle phase-based communication channels that have been
there all along, quietly coordinating the orchestra of life.
